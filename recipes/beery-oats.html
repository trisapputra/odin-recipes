        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>uncooked oats</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>Fresh blueberry and strawberry</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon plain nonfat yogurt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon unsweetened coconut</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon honey </li>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Stir in oats. Cook uncovered over medium heat, 
                1 minute for Quick Oats, 5 minutes for Old Fashioned Oats, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place berries, chia seeds, cinnamon, and ginger into blender or food processor container. Process until fruits are pureed. If mixture seems too thick, add water 1 tablespoon at a time to reach desired consistency.
                Swirl into bowl of cooked oats. Serve topped with yogurt, coconut, and honey.
            </li>
